                <p>
                    One prayer lap equals a complete series of community prayers covering every populated place in the world.

                                We have identified 4,770 administrative divisions into which the countries of the world are divided. This website guides prayer warriors to pray over these specific locations.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When our community prays for the "kingdom to come" over one of these divisions for one minute or more, then we mark that location as covered for that prayer lap.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Once all the divisions of the world have been prayed for, then we close that prayer lap, start a new lap, and reset the master clock.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We hope that our community completes each prayer lap faster than the previous. Can you imagine a global community praying forever place in the world every 10 minutes? We dream that.

                                Inspired by the <a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/history/issues/issue-1/prayer-meeting-that-lasted-100-years.html" target="_blank">Moravians</a>, who prayed non-stop for 100 years,
                                we have crafted this website to help the church pray for the entire world in measurable units, as a community, and to know at the end when we have finished ... and are ready to start
                                another lap.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Once every location in the world has been prayed for, we finish a lap. The prayer map resets and we try to pray over the world again
                                ... maybe faster.
